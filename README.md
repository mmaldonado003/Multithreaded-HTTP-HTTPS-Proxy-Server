# Multithreaded HTTP/HTTPS Proxy Server

**ALL FILES PERTAINING TO THE PROJECT CAN BE VIEWED ABOVE.**

## Objective
Network monitoring and security tool that handles concurrent 
connections, enforces security policies (domain blocking, rate limiting), 
and generates detailed analytics for IT operations and capacity planning.

Demonstrates practical application of network programming, security policy 
enforcement, and analytics.

Generated only if `Log` option is enabled and matplotlib is installed.

## Tested With / Usage

- **Browsers:** Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox
- **Local machine configuration (Windows):** added proxy in network settings using the port specified at launch
- Works for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic
- Supports multiple simultaneous clients

## Setup

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmaldonado003/Multithreaded-HTTP-HTTPS-Proxy-Server.git
cd Multithreaded-HTTP-HTTPS-Proxy-Server
```

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- **Optional (for charts)** — matplotlib:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### Start the Proxy:

**Without logging:**
```bash
python3 main.py [PORT]
```

**With logging** (creates detailed logs, database, and charts in `Logs/`):
```bash
python3 main.py [PORT] Log
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 main.py 8080 Log
```

### Folder Structure:
- `main.py` — entry point
- `proxy.py` — handles client connections
- `handlers.py` — HTTP/HTTPS request handling
- `logging_utils.py` — logs requests, blocked requests, summaries, and charts
- `utils.py` — shared constants and helper functions
- `db_logger.py` — SQLite database logging functions
- `database_setup.py` — database schema initialization
- `analytics.py` — query and export database analytics

### Database Analytics:

**View traffic statistics:**
```bash
python3 analytics.py
```

**Export data to CSV:**
```bash
python3 analytics.py
# Choose 'y' when prompted to export
```

**Output locations:**
- Database: `Logs/Database/proxy_traffic.db`
- CSV Export: `Logs/Database/traffic_export.csv`

## Technical Analysis

- **Performance:** Measures request duration and TTFB per domain
- **Load:** Identifies which domains consume the most bandwidth or requests
- **Blocking:** Confirms blocked domains are logged and prevented from connecting
- **Rate Limiting:** Observes how rapid requests from a single IP are handled with 429 responses
- **Database Queries:** Supports complex analytics queries for historical trend analysis
